Skils Assesment for Steady Rain:
Uses Postgres Npgsql provider,
Uses Dapper as an orm,
Uses Serilog trace logging,

Front end: ~4 hours (sorry, im not much of a front end guy but enjoyed the challenge)
Back end: less than 1 hour
Database Configuration: less than 1 hour

Missing Components:
Pagination,
Spinners after data entry

Tools Used:
Postman,
PGAdmin4,
VSCodes Live Server for writing the html, css, and js,
VS2022,
Linqpad for writing POCO's and service interfaces

Takeaways:
* A desire to learn front end better
* VS Code is great for writing quick html,css,and js files without the overhead of VS
* I researched Knockout JS but didnt have time to implement it given the ~4hr constraint
    * KnockoutJS uses MVVM architechture
    * WPF uses MVVM Architechture
    * I believe I could pick up KnockoutJS quickly given they use the same Architecture
    * WPF's strength is it's databinding capabilities, the same as KnockoutJS data-bind syntax
